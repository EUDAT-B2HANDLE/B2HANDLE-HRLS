This project provides a servlet which offers search on Handle records including simple reverse lookup, i.e., finding a Handle if only a target URL is known.<br/>
At the backend, the servlet supports two options: A Handle SQL storage or search via a separate Solr index. The default setup of the Handle Server software based on BerkeleyDB is not supported.<br/>

The servlet is implemented based on JAX-RS 2.0 and can be deployed for instance in a Tomcat container or an (embedded) Jetty.

<h2>Deployment in the embedded Handle Server 8 Jetty</h2>

The path <code>{HANDLE_HOME}</code> is the home directory of the target Handle server, for example <code>~/hs/svr_1</code>.

<ol>
<li>Copy the .war to <code>{HANDLE_HOME}/webapps</code>.</li>
<li>Accessing the servlet's web methods requires authentication. Currently, HTTP Basic Authentication is supported. To enable this, a file <code>{HANDLE_HOME}/realm.properties</code> must be created. The format of this file is described <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Jetty/Tutorial/Realms" target="_blank">here (HashLoginService)</a>. The rolename for Handle search is "handle-search".</li>
<li>The servlet requires a properties file <code>{HANDLE_HOME}/handlereverselookupservlet.properties</code>with details on how to connect to the SQL or Solr storage for searching. The full format of this file is given further below.  (If deployed via Tomcat, the parameters should be provided as Servlet init params via context.xml.)</li>
<li>If you configure the servlet for SQL access, you need to place the driver's .jar file in the Handle Server's lib directory.</li>
<li>Start your Handle server.</li>
<li>The reverse lookup service can be accessed under the server's subpath <code>/hrls</code>. A simple test may be to call http://your.server/hrls/ping - this should ask for authentication.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Servlet properties configuration file format</h2>

The <code>handlereverselookupservlet.properties</code> file format is as follows. The file consists of two blocks, one for SQL and one for Solr. At least one of either must be present.
<pre>
useSql = true
sqlConnectionString = (your SQL connection string)
sqlUsername = (user)
sqlPassword = (password)
jdbcDriverClassName = (your JDBC driver class name)

useSolr = true
solrCollection = (name of your Solr collection)
solrCloudZkHost = (Zookeeper host and port)
</pre>

<h2>Requests logging</h2>

To enable logging of all requests, include the following in the <code>handlereverselookupservlet.properties</code> file:

<pre>
logAllQueries = true
serviceName = MyHRLSService
</pre>

The serviceName is optional and will be used in each log message.<br/>
To customize the logging output format, you can provide your own <code>log4j2.xml</code> file using a java environment parameter: <code>-Dlog4j.configurationFile=path/to/log4j2.xml</code><br/>
The log messages contain the following information:
<ol>
<li> Source IP address</li>
<li> Status code</li>
<li> Time taken to process requests (in milliseconds)</li>
<li> User name used to authenticate</li>
<li> Original query (part of the URL)</li>
</ol>

The status codes are:
<ul>
<li>0: Query OK, but result set empty.</li>
<li>1: Query OK and results provided.</li>
<li>2: User tried to request HS_SECKEY information, which was denied.</li>
<li>3: User asked to force SQL usage to answer request, but server is not configured for SQL.</li>
</ul>
